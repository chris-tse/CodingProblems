## Algorithms

### Pyramid ###

Write a function called `pyramid(n)` which prints out a pyramid of a character of your choice. The function should accept an integer as an argument which is the width of the base of the pyramid.

Example:
```
> pyramid(5)

>   0
   000
  00000

> pyramid(8)

>    00
    0000
   000000
  00000000
```

### Implement Stack as Queue
[Link to LeetCode problem page](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/tabs/description)

Implement the following operations of a stack using queues:
- `push(x)` - push element `x` to top of stack
- `pop()` - removes and returns the top element of the stack
- `top()` - returns the top element but does not remove it
- `empty()` - return whether the stack is empty
